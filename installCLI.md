# Installing gh on Linux and BSD
Packages downloaded from https://cli.github.com or from https://github.com/cli/cli/releases are considered official binaries. We focus on popular Linux distros and the following CPU architectures: i386, amd64, arm64, armhf.

Other sources for installation are community-maintained and thus might lag behind our release schedule.
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh
